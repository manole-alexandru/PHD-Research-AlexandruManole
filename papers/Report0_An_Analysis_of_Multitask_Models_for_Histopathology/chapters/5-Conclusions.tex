In conclusion, Multi-task Learning is a powerful and versatile learning strategy, which can be exploited in order to create effective encoders applicable in numerous tasks with no required change. The valuable features mined by this intelligent approach can be used to obtain multiple relevant medical information through a single model pass, reducing training and inference time. This paradigm which lead to impressive performance in multiple tasks is still in early phases, at least in the medical image analysis area, leaving space for future research directions which could investigate relevant areas which were not yet covered by the existing literature. It is our firm belief that the current state of MT networks warrants further study especially when it comes to  cross-talk techniques and possible fusions between supervised and semi-supervised or unsupervised objectives.
